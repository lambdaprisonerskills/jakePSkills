              <h2>South Carolina Takes
                  the Initiative</h2>
              <P>"Three companies have set up successful joint ventures
                  that employ over 400 inmates in South
                  Carolina’s prisons. Major companies and
                  institutions like IBM, Victoria’s Secret,
                  and Emory University purchase products
                  manufactured in South Carolina’s prisons."<br>

              <h2>What is Prison Labor?</h2>
              <P>"Some call prison labor the new Jim Crow 
                because of the outsized number of black and 
                brown inmates in U.S. prisons. It's a facile 
                charge, and worse, it may be keeping progressive 
                companies away from prison projects. Socially 
                conscious businesses and agencies are likely to 
                pay inmates higher wages, train them for better 
                jobs and do more to prepare them for life after 
                prison — if those companies aren't scared away by 
                vociferous critics of prison labor."<br><span>By Chandra Bozelko</span><br>

                <h2>Out of Prison & Out of Work</h2>
                <P>"Estimate of unemployment among the 5 million 
                  formerly incarcerated people living in the United 
                  States. Our analysis shows that formerly incarcerated 
                  people are unemployed at a rate of over 27% — higher 
                  than the total U.S. unemployment rate during any historical 
                  period, including the Great Depression."

                <h2>What We Do!</h2>
                <P>We seek to help forward-thinking inmates who are motivated to
                    better and prepare themselves for their post-prison futures. The unemployment rate is tragically
                    high for former inmates, so our goal is to give them a leg up.
                    At the same time we give them the opportunity to develop and improve their skills
                    while making some money along the way.

                <h2>A Prisoner's Testimonial</h2>
                <P>
                    "My prison job made me feel like I was fulfilling my 
                    existential duty to society: I was contributing. It 
                    doesn't surprise me that prison work assignments are 
                    credited with reducing recidivism. Any change for good 
                    that happened within me while I was incarcerated grew 
                    out of my job. If I feel that way about my time making 
                    chicken a la king, an inmate who's saving lives fighting 
                    fires must feel it 10 times over."

                <h2>What we Believe</h2>
                <P>We believe there are a lot of prisoners out there who deserve second chances.
                    Unfortunately, there is a huge societal stigma that has been cast onto all prisoners,
                    making second chances seem impossible. We are here to break that stigma and to
                    create mutually beneficial second chances.</P>
